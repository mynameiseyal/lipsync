Not the fastest guy in the world—he's not breaking the sound barrier, okay?—but he gets where he needs to go. Sometimes he's fast, sometimes he's… you know, not so fast. It happens. I know all about that.",

But he does his best, and that's what counts. Some people say, \"Sir, can you find anything on his desk?\" Well, maybe, maybe not. But at least he tries.",

It's like The Apprentice, but nobody gets fired! If there's a bug, they hunt it down faster than the FBI. I'm telling you, folks, they're the real stars. I wish my cabinet worked that well.",
